# Information regarding the policies

These policies were crafted for the use case:
- [Delfour-Scanner](delfour-scanner-policy.ttl): The policy that allows the scanner to see all the products of Delfour
- [Instantiated Preferences](./preferences-policy(inst).ttl): Instantiated policy that allows shopping preferences to be read to show alternative products
- [Legitimate interest](./legitimate-interest-policy.ttl): Instantiated policy that allows Delfour to keep pseudo-anomymised data about users' purchasing habits under legitimate interest

## Questions that need to be resolved

- What is the actual location for the preferences? -> these need to replace `ex:preferences`
- Is a scanner an individual entity or part of delfour?
  - Is the assignee of a permission: `the scanner of delfour` or just `delfour`
  - This question came up while creating a policy for delfour that allows the products to be seen at scanner level
    - can be resolved/ignored if that data is public
- What is the location/description for "pseudo-anonymised data about purchasing habits"?
  - Should techniques be mentioned for which pseudonimisation techniques were used to do that? Or is that part of the trust envelope?
    - e.g. k-anonymity or differential privacy
      - k-anon: Ensures each record is indistinguishable from at least kâ€“1 others
      - differential privacy: Adds mathematical noise to data queries to obscure individual contributions
  - this problem resembles the [member derived view problem (unresolved)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kq4hZvxRBozEqqmKWtdJ_O87PYArPBIpzO6g9BewBkc/edit?slide=id.g36b90bd1b63_0_590#slide=id.g36b90bd1b63_0_590)
    - who owns the source data: the shopping list information
- There is only a left operand for full anonymisation; not pseudoanonymisation.
