# UC: Purpose-based medical data exchange 

## Short description

Ruben allows doctors to have access to his electronic health records (EHRs) for primary care and remote consultations. Under the new EHDS regulation, this data can also be re-used for certain secondary purposes, however Ruben can opt-out, and opt-in again, from any use at at any point. Ruben also wants to get annual updates on how his data is being used to improve healthcare of diabetes patients.
