## Discussion

NOTE: everything is recorded
Joachim shows demo: https://github.com/PoTr-KNoWS/delfour-diabetes-script

Should Trust Envelope have purpose?

Goes over the summary of the changes to the UMA server: https://github.com/PoTr-KNoWS/delfour-diabetes-script?tab=readme-ov-file#v002

Currently, the Resource Server has to know a lot of context
Jos: maybe bring everything together just in time
Comment on that, but who is allowed to make the deriviation? Sometimes data cannot be disclosed
Later comment here: maybe it could be just a **proxy in front of the infrastructure** that brings it just in time together and create the envelope

RV: deploy online and freeze development here
-> Wouter will do that if Joachim creates the tags and how it actually works

Freeze: as in do not continue on the branch. Do not go on here

Change ruben web id -> UUID (just html)

Trust Envelope does not mean too much then, policies are also throw away

Also make a screencast

The questions/comments should be hosted on https://github.com/PoTr-KNoWS/use-cases/tree/main/delfour

Beatriz organises how we gonna create the structure for gathering the questions

RV: we are not going to solve the questions immediately and move on to a second scenario

PHylosofical:
- Are HTTP headers similar; the same as trust envelopes?
	- or do trust envelopes capture more of the world?

Should a trust envelope be part of a HTTP header (e.g. in the Authorization token)?

## Next steps

- [ ] Wouter
  - [ ] put the live script online (dependent on Joachim, perhaps ask Pieter Heyvaert for help)
- [ ] Joachim
  - [ ] adjust webID in demo
  - [ ] freeze development -> create tags
  - [ ] create screencast (perhaps from the recording)?
- [ ] Beatriz
  - [ ] Create structure so we can group the questions and comments that have been created for this sprint
