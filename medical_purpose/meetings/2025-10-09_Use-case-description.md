## Discussion
https://knows-research.atlassian.net/browse/RS-505
Purpose-based medical data exchange

-> related to PACSOI PoC2
https://github.com/besteves4/pacsoi-policies/tree/main/PoC2


From sprint 1: we have purpose as claim
from Wouts work: we can evaluate purpose by adding it as context to the **Evaluation request**
-> see https://github.com/SolidLabResearch/ODRL-Evaluator/tree/feat/purpose


RV: Secondary reuse about medical data. You consent very easily (without knowing it actually)

With purpose based medical exchange and trust envelopes, do we still need secondary reuse?

Cancer/ long covid patients are willing to share data
- first to be cured
- second such that nobody has to endure the same as they did

Beatriz needs to elaborate the focus of this sprint more.

## Next steps

- [ ] Beatriz
  - [ ] Further elaboration of the use case (last 15 mins of recording, did we understand it correctly)
